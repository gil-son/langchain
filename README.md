# 🤖 LangChain

**LangChain** is a framework for developing applications powered by large language models (LLMs). LangChain provides building blocks to connect LLMs with tools like APIs, vector stores, memory, and more, enabling complex, intelligent applications like chatbots, agents, and search systems.

## 📚 What is LangChain?

LangChain is a Python (and JavaScript) framework designed to:

- Connect LLMs to external data (e.g., documents, databases).
- Enable LLMs to perform reasoning and decision-making.
- Build chains of prompts and actions.
- Create autonomous agents with memory and tools.

It simplifies building apps like:

- Chatbots with memory and context
- RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) systems
- Document Q&A systems
- LLM-powered agents and workflows

## ⚙️ Features

- 🔗 **Chains** – Compose sequences of calls (prompt + LLM + tool).
- 🧠 **Memory** – Add long- or short-term memory to your agents.
- 📄 **Document Loaders** – Easily load and process PDFs, websites, docs.
- 🧩 **Embeddings & Vector Stores** – Plug in OpenAI, FAISS, Pinecone, etc.
- 🧠 **Agents** – Let LLMs make decisions using tools like calculators, APIs.
- 🌐 **Tool Integration** – Connect to APIs, web search, SQL databases, etc.
